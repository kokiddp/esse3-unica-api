An API set for Esse3 of Unica. University of Cagliari.

The platform Unica Esse3 doesn't provide any form of api in order to obtain user information, user exams, user taxes etc. 

Unica-esse3-api is a set of API that allows all developers to create their own Esse3 application using user data information. 

This set of API doesn't save any king of information, password or else about the user. 

With this API you can get: 

- User general info


- User profile image
- User careers
- User exams
- Taxes
